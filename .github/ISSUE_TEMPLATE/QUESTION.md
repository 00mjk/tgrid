I always welcome any questions about the **TGrid**. However, half of questions can be solved by traveling [Guide Documents](https://github.com/samhon/tgrid/wiki), [FAQ](https://github.com/samhon/tgrid/wiki/FAQ) section, or old [Issues](https://github.com/samchon/tgrid/search?type=Issues). Please visit them before. If you have a question have not treated and you're urgently, then you also can utilize the [Gitter Channel](https://gitter.im/samchon/tgrid).
